Through our comprehensive education initiatives, we provide school fee support, scholastic materials, tutoring, and after-school programs that enable children to attend school and succeed academically.

Our after-school programs provide remedial tutoring, mentorship, and life skills training that help students develop both academically and personally.

We also invest in teacher training and school infrastructure improvements, recognizing that quality education requires well-trained teachers and adequate learning facilities. By partnering with local schools, we help build capacity and ensure sustainable education outcomes.`,

For refugees facing legal challenges, we provide referrals to legal aid organizations and pro bono lawyers who can offer professional support. We also work with community leaders and refugee advocates to build local capacity for rights education and protection.

Our advocacy work extends to policy engagement, where we advocate for refugee-friendly policies at local and national levels. We work with government agencies, international organizations, and other stakeholders to ensure that refugee voices are heard in decisions that affect their lives.`,
